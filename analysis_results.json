        "human_readable_summary": "The patch introduces a condition to check the page reference count before freeing data, but it incorrectly removes the line that updates the page state to PAGE_FREE. This leaves the page structure in an inconsistent state where it may appear active to other parts of the kernel while its internal data buffer has been deallocated, resulting in a Use-After-Free vulnerability."
