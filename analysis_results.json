        "human_readable_summary": "This patch corrects the control flow in the LE Secure Connections (LE SC) pairing random command handler to ensure that temporary security keys (mackey and ltk) are generated before subsequent pairing steps, even during device repairing. A previous regression caused a bypass of key generation via an ill-placed goto. It also simplifies the Just Works handling logic, ensuring user confirmation is always requested for Just Works pairings.",
